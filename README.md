# SHINE

A repository containing the code, inputs and outputs created for the project "Assessing SHINE features in the Lake District National Park using the NCA/Cultural Capital process". 

Note: Some input data (e.g. SHINE, Historic Environment Records) may need to be removed due to licencing restrictions.
